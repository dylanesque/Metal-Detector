        <h2>What is Metal Detector?</h2>
            <p>I love metal music, and I love sharing that love of metal with others.
                But like many other esoteric fields, it can be difficult to know where
                to start. I wanted to create a a more personally curated experience that's
                a bit friendlier than what's currently out there, sort of like The AV Club's
            Gateways to Geekery series.</p>
